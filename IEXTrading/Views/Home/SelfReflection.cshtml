    <u><h1><b>Stock Picking Strategy</b></h1></u>
    
    Based on the references provided , we opted the Week52 Price Range Strategy to select the top 5 stocks from the quotes
    We used close price, week52Low, week52High to calculate the Price momentum of each stock symbol.
    <br />
    In the Companies API result set , we found some companies whose names are empty and whose isEnabled value is zero and whose companies types are not N/A.
    We've handled these scenarios and removed companies which are not valid.
    <br />
    Price Momentum=(Close - Week52Low)/(Week52High-Week52Low)
    <br />
    From the above formula, their were some stocks whose Week52 high and low values are 0 which are resulting in making price momentum value as Infinity. We have removed those stocks as well for clean data.
    <br />
    There were many stocks whose Price Momentum value is more than 82%.Hence, we displayed only the top 5 stocks among them. There were also stocks whose total volume is less or not upto the mark. According to the current market trend, we have set an average volume of stock over 39 Million for some decent stocks which are genuinely top.

    We have read the details of the IEX Trading API and created Model called Quotes to read the API details. We have used the 52-Week Price Range Strategy which calculates the Price momentum ratio to take the top 5 stocks whose score is 82% or higher.
